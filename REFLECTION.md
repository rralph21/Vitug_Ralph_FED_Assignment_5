## Assignment
Assignment 5 - JavaScript Async

## Intro
This project connects to the City of Winnipeg Open Data API to display tree information.

## Mechanics
When a user type a tree's common name like Ash or Maple and clicks "Search", the program will show the top 100 largest trees that matches the name.

# List

- The number of each tree in the ranking
- The Tree's common name
- The diameter of the tree's trunk - Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)

# fetch and Async

- API returns different data formats (JSON).
- responses might take time, so async code is needed to handle it smoothly.
- error handling is important to avoid breaking the script.
I can display live, updated data without refreshing the page.

## Summary

This Assignment has allowed me to work on script that can connect to real time data using API, how to handle the data and display it.
